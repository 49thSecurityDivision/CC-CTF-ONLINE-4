# CarolinaCon Online 2024 CTF

Greetings, Carolinas! 

The CarolinaCon Online 2024 CTF runs from November 1st, 2024 at 2100 EDT through November 3rd at 1200 EDT. 

All challenges begin at 500 points and decrement 10 points per solve for all participants (including those who already solved it).

The rules for CTF are as follows:

1. Teams are capped at 5 members per team 
2. Lifelines are not allowed. Do not get hints/answers from non-team members or other teams. Violations of this rule may result in a public scolding or a ban 
3. Hints for challenges will be posted in appropriate Discord channels and in CTFd
4. If a challenge has any solves, no future hints will be given
5. Challenges will be added throughout the CTF. The times of these challenge drops will be announced in Discord and on CTFd at least 30 minutes in advance
6. If a challenge is broken or if you broke it, please let us know and we can easily reset the challenge at no penalty to anyone or any team
7. Some challenges involve gaining a shell on a remote server. If you deliberately abuse any remote challenges such that players can no longer use them, you will be publicly scolded and possibly banned
8. If you have any questions about any challenges, please ask an admin. These questions can be asked publicly in Discord or an admin can be DM-ed, but all admin responses to a specific challenge question will be posted/re-posted in an appropriate Discord channel and/or CTFd unless it reveals a flag
9. Have fun. If the CTF isn't fun, interesting, or educational in any way, please let us know. We may not be able to fix it this CTF, but your feedback will make a difference. Every CarolinaCon CTF has been crafted based on previous feedback, so don't be afraid to let us know what you think, even if your thoughts are critical
10. Be cool. We work hard on the CTF and we want everyone to have fun!
