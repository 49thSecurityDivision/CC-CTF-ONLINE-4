# Solve 

This is a ROP challenge that will require a constraint solver to complete (unless I overlooked something).

I used `angr` to solve this, though there are probably a zillion other ways to solve it; but with `angr`, I could solve it in about 20-30 minutes by writing a python script. I have included a `payload.txt` file that was generated by my `angr` script, which can be used like `./motivation < payload.txt` to solve the challenge

`cc_ctf{50_4ngr_m0t1v4t35_y0u_t00_huh_?}`

(the flag is defined in the `Dockerfile` for this challenge)
