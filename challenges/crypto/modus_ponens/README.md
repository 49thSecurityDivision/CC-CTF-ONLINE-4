# Prompt

I have invented a method of cryptography so secure that I can send the same message to
six different people, each receiving the same message. But, here's the catch... each
person receives a file that looks totally different from the other five...

Oh, also, I only speak English...

*NOTE:* Depending on when you download the file for the challenge, it will be different from what it was before, which is fine. It does not break the challenge.

# Solution

This is character frequency analysis. I could not get the SHRDLU part to work,
but if you do character analysis using ETAOIN, it becomes very clear as you
chip away at more obvious letters what the message says.

`cc_ctf{l00ks_l1k3_y0u_f1gur3d_1t_0ut}`
